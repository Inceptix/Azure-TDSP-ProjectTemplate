 # Cassava Leaf Disease Project Structure

This is a general project directory structure that references the Team Data Science Process developed by Microsoft. 

[Team Data Science Process (TDSP)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/team-data-science-process/overview) is an agile, iterative, data science methodology to improve collaboration and team learning. It is supported through a lifecycle definition, standard project structure, artifact templates, and [tools](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-TDSP-Utilities) for productive data science. 

**NOTE:** In this directory structure, the **Sample_Data folder is NOT supposed to contain LARGE raw or processed data**. It is only supposed to contain **small and sample** data sets, which could be used to test the code.

The two documents under Docs/Project, namely the [Charter](./Docs/Project/Charter.md) and [Exit Report](./Docs/Project/Exit%20Report.md) are particularly important to consider. They help to define the project at the start of an engagement, and provide a final report.

This project stems from the [Cassava Leaf Disease Classification Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/cassava-leaf-disease-classification).
